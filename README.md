Strava Real Pace
================

This is a Greasemonkey script which replaces moving pace on Strava (which is the only visible pace metric) with actual pace, which I find more useful. This allows you to understand the impact of having to stop during a run/ride, whereas the default ignores the time you spend standing still.

Installation / Usage
--------------------

Currently, this script requires you to register your own application on the Strava developer API, and replace the access token with your own. After that, you can install the Greasemonkey script and enjoy your newfound more accurate metrics.
